            <p class="text-body">2016 has been a very exciting year this past eight months but that does not mean that the 4 last month of the year can't make it any better, right? <br/> For the rest of the year I'm planning on taking my coding skills to the next level. Done with the amateur stuff I want to start working on my personal goals, even though I'm still "new" in the programming world.</p> <p class="text-body
                "> <strong>First</strong> I'm going to take full advantage of my programming classes to improve my skills, along with the professor's feedback I beleive that t will make me a better programmer. <strong>Second</strong> Im planing on embracing my personal projects and to work on them while I'm working on school stuff.</p>
            <p class="text-body">Well that's pretty much it I'm a simple person with a lot of ambission. I don't like to talk about my personal project because I believe that people shouldn't announce their next move. I'm just hoping to gain a lot of knowledge with my classes and on my own so I can make 2017 the year in wich I can launch my own bussiness. Also from MMP 310 I'm hopping on learning really cool stuff in JavaScript. Before the class I had no idea what it would be abput, but after the first day I think I have a grasp on it.</p>
